        Since 2016 we worked on a multitude of compiler and tools projects with
        companies from different industries. The invariant observation is
        that projects are all very different. There is no way to know in advance what
        the dominating complexity will be next time. Our answer to it is an
        approach that we call <a href="sprints-and-breaks">Sprints and Breaks</a>.

      When a client reaches out, we usually ask to arrange a
      <a href="https://calendly.com/stefan-graenitz/30min">30 to 60 minutes
      intro call</a>.
      In order to be effective, a <i>technically versed person</i> from the
      client side must attend the meeting.
      In part 1 we introduce each other and our roles and responsibilities.
      The goal of part 2 is to answer a number of questions essential for
      planning the first sprint. The below check-lists may give some
      inspirition. The more of these questions we can answer the better we can
      plan the first sprint.

          Structuring efforts is one of the fundamental requirements when
          working on <i>high complexity tasks</i>.
          We rarely know in advance what causes a problem on the implementation
          level or what it takes to fix it.
          We have to start with estimations.
          And if we don't have enough understanding to make an estimation, then
          we take one step back and try to estimate how long it will take to
          gain this understanding.
        </li>
        <li>
          This leads to the concept of sprints:
          <i>A sprint is a time-boxed block of work</i> that aims to complete a
          well-specified task.
          On the executive level, it might be a feature implementation in a
          code base.
          On the preparatory level, it might as well be about finding answers to
          a given number of questions.
          Once we know the answers, we revisit our planning and decide what
          the next step would be.
          If we didn't manage to complete the sprint within the time limit,
          it's a signal to revisit the previous planning.
        </li>
        <li>
          Making good decisions under uncertainty is never easy and must not be
          hurried.
          Having breaks between sprints allows all participants to evaluate results,
          revisit their relevance for the overall project goals and prepare their
          inputs for the next sprint.
          Breaks improve the quality of our next planning.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Time-boxed breaks are a matter of efficiency</i>.
          There's this common practice for meetings: The more people attend, the
          more we must prepare and focus our own attendence.
          That's because time is precious and it is hardly acceptable to waste other
          people's time casually on a scale.
          For the same reason we should allow for fixed breaks between sprints.
          Clients often work on many different parts of their products
          concurrently.
          Naturally, review and planning don't score their deserved priorities in
          the battle for engineering time.
          Giving clients enough time to schedule such tasks is <i>key for decent
          feedback</i> and that's what breaks are all about.
        </li>
        <li>
          In our experience, Sprints and Breaks is the best way to approach new
          projects in a time-efficient and plannable manner. That said, we will always
          be open to hear your take on the topic!
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Sprint One</h2>

          In our experience there are more questions than hands-on tasks in the
          beginning of a project.
          The first sprint is usually packed with research and <i>two weeks</i>
          is a good time-frame to understand the issue and prepare input for
          planning the next steps.
          In order to make sure our understanding of the problem matches yours,
          we will have a lot of questions as well.
          Thus, a technically versed person from the client side must be
          <i>reachable during the first sprint</i> &mdash; anything like Slack,
          Discord or E-Mail is fine.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sometimes issues turn out to be simple, e.g. if we investigate a bug
          and we find a workaround that is "good enough" for the client's
          purposes. In such cases projects can be finished within a single
          sprint!
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="text">
      <h2>Break One</h2>
      <ul class="paragraphs">
        <li>
          For the sprint review meeting we send over a decision diagram to help
          the client decide on the way forward.
          Once all questions are answered the client can use the break time for
          internal evaluations and decision making in preparation for the next
          sprint.
        </li>
        <li>
          In our experienced two weeks is a good time-frame for the first break.
          That said, there are always cases where clients are in a hurry or a
          technical expert is out-of-office.
          We are always eager to vary the two-weeks pattern and meet your
          demands.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <div class="text">
      <h2>Repeat</h2>
      <ul class="paragraphs">
        <li>
          The sequence of Sprints and Breaks repeats until the project is done.
          Over time less and less client feedback is necessary and so sprints
          can get longer.
          This can be the case once larger implementation efforts are required
          while goals, requirements and design already became clear.
